#+title: Stochastic optimization algorithms

Homework solutions to the Stochastic optimization algotithms course at
Chalmers.

Non-stochastic:
- Newton-Rhapson's method :: Tutorial to matlab
- Penalty method :: Another method for finding optima

Stochastic:
- Matlab into :: An introduction to stochastic algorithms, a basic genetic algorithm with tournament selection.
- Ant colony :: Algorithm for finding optimal paths in a network, in this case the travelling salesman problem.
- Particle swarm :: Find optima by using swarms of particles with flocking behavious.
- Genetic algorithm/neural network :: Train a neural network with a
  genetic algorithm instead of backpropagation. In this case, for
  finding efficient braking strategy for a truck going downhill.
- Linear genetic programming :: Evolve computer programs to curve fit a function.
